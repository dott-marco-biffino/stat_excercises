```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, results="hide")
```

```{r data_gen}
n<- sample(5:20, size = 1)
bottom<- sample(1:30, size = 1)
top<- sample(40:100, size = 1)
x<- sample(bottom:top, size = n)

choice<- runif(1)
if (choice > 0.5) {
  res<- mean(x)
  req<- "arithmetic mean"

```

Question
========

Given the following data collected on a sample of xxx:

`r paste(x, collapse = "; ")`,

compute the `r req`.

Solution
========

Correct answer: 

the `r req` is `r round(res, 3)`

Meta-information
================
extype: num
exsolution: `r fmt(res)`
exname: mean or median
extol: 0.001
